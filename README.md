## My process

### Built with

- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) - Styling
- [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox) - Page layout
- [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) - Page layout
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Query](https://npmjs.com/package/@tenstack/react-query) - Fetching Data
- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - Handling Routing
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Animations

### What I learned

 - I learnt to use React Query for data fetching in place of UseEffect to stop unnecessary re-renders.
 - I also learnt how to use Framer-motion to animate different sections into view.

### Continued development

- The site is not responsive on smaler screens. I hope to work on that in the future.
- I would also like to improve on the page contents and form actions as well.
